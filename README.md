## Issues in Upgrade

The purpose of unlocking the phone is that I want to brush my favorite third-party ROM. But when Taobao sellers unlock my phone, the system version is back to EMUI5.0 (Android 7), this version is too laggy and unsafe, and he never told me that this version could not be upgraded. NO WAY! I tried to upgrade it's version to the latest EMUI8.0, but I failed. Damn it, I've gone through all the solutions I can find online, but [this
post](https://club.huawei.com/thread-17096431-1-1.html?extra=filter%3Dtypeid%26typeid%3D4298%26page%3D1) turns my cell phone into a black brick. I don't know why, when I press the power button, the phone doesn't respond. Finally, the taobao seller rescued the black brick. And then I fuck it up again, phone's system dismissed until now. So if you want to upgrade your phone, please be careful and think it clear. Attention you ROM version, don't learn me again!

## Summary

After closing the official EMUI website,
which allowed you to retrieve the code to unlock the bootloader of Huawei/Honor phones, 
here is a python script to test many possible codes.

It uses a bruteforce method, based on the IMEI identifier to generate unlocking codes.

This will most likely only work on European versions, 
because these only use numbers in the bootloader unlock code.
Actually Chinese version also wrok yet.

I've only had the opportunity to test it on European versions:
- Honor  5x 8x and 9x
- Honor  view 10 and 20
- Honor  10 lite
- Huawei p20 lite
- Huawei Y6 2019
- Huawei p30
- Huawei Mate 9


## Instructions

1. Enable developer options in Android.
1. Enable USB debugging in Android.
1. Connect your device to the computer and launch the script.

    Windows:
    ```batch
    C:\WINDOWS\system32> python unlock.py
    ```
    Linux/macOS:
    ```shell
    $ python3 unlock.py
    ```
    The device is going to ask for authorisation, which you'll have to allow.  
    Please also check the checkbox "Always allow from this computer".
1. Wait for the application to detect your device. The device info should appear.
1. Enter the (first) IMEI.
1. Start the bruteforce.  
    (this may take several ~~hours~~ days) so get a cup of coffee â˜• and go to sleep. ðŸ’« 
1. If the correct code is found, your phone will either be instantly unlocked or prompt you with an additional confirmation dialogue on the target device.  
    (all data will be erased on unlock!)


## FAQ & Troubleshooting

**- The application doesn't work. Is there anything I should have installed?**  
Yes, it was developed in python so it needs it to run, version 3. You can install the latest version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or by using Windows Store.

**- The app on Windows doesn't detect my device even though it's connected and USB debugging is enabled. What could be the issue?**  
Windows most likely doesn't recognise your device in ADB mode. Install the universal ADB drivers from [here](http://dl.adbdriver.com/upload/adbdriver.zip), reboot your PC and try again.

**- My phone reboots every 5 failed attempts**  
We are aware of this and have implemented an automatic intentional reboot after 4 attempts.  
You can manually enable this feature in the code.  
The script will also automatically detect this behaviour. For this to work reliably, please check the checkbox "Always allow from this computer" in the adb dialogue.

**- The script displays "command invalid"**  
Huawei has removed the unlock command in EMUI 10.  
Downgrade your software and try again.
